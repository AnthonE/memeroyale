// THE MYTHIC TIER.
// One signature weapon per named POI, waiting in that POI's payoff / hero chest every match (loot.ts placeLoot marks the
// chest; rollChestContents fills it). A mythic is a named variant of an existing gun: the gun's own handling, damage of
// a legendary + ~12 % (const.ts RARITY_MUL.mythic), its own colour.
//
// Wire / sim encoding: a rarity byte ≥ MYTHIC_R is a mythic — `rarity - MYTHIC_R` = its index in MYTHICS (items, slots,
// inventory frames carry the full byte). rarityOf() says "mythic" for all of them; tables keyed by tier use
// rarityTier() (0..5). A remote kong's held byte carries the tier only (MYTHIC_R): remotes draw the generic mythic.
// Kill feed: EV.Kill's weapon byte is KILL_MYTHIC + index for a mythic kill (killWeapon()).
